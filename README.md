It includes information on 174,000 businesses globally and spans from business attributes to checkins and tips.  Exploratory data analysis was conducted to get an overview of the types of businesses using Yelp, suggest improvements for particular restaurants, and understand how people are using Yelp to interact with businesses.

The 'Business' dataset contains business ID, address, number of stars, number of reviews, and other business-specific fields for each business.
The 'Business Attributes' dataset contains common features and offerings of each business, such as parking availability, dogs allowed, wifi, and credit card acceptance.
The 'Checkins' dataset contains the business, day, and hour associated with each Yelp user checkin.
The 'Tips' dataset contains the tip date, text, Yelp user ID, number of likes, and business it was left for.
